This is just a short repo for the compiled Xblast Lite firmware for the Xilinx CPLD which includes LCD output and the extended features of the 'Lite' version.

Minimal syntax error fixed in code for LCD output and compiled to .jed ready for CPLD. Fully tested on pictured black Xblast Lite chip.

Historically, not published anywhere due to people being awkward as usual in the so called 'xbox scene'.

You will have to follow the schematic and make yourself a PCB for it in your EDA software of choice.

Enjoy!
